            <p><span id="hobby_names">Rick & Morty</span> is a new show that was born out of Channel 101, a cool org in LA where viewers 'vote' on the content they want to see. It's now moved beyond Channel 101 and is played on Adult Swim. The show follows a boy (Rick) and his grandpa (Morty) as they go on space adventures! Wubalubadubdub!</p>

        <div id="music">
            <p><span id="hobby_names">Bros Boogies</span> is a public playlist on Spotify that me and a couple friends curate. Every week, each friend submits 4 of their favorite songs and no two songs can have the same artist. I thought of Bros Boogies as a way to find new music ... I used to love Spotify's Discover Weekly playlist but it's a bit too personalized and songs are repeated in different weeks. Check out the playlist and add a song or two!</p>
